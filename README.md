# GiphyApp

![output](https://raw.github.com/villanuv/giphy-app/master/screens.jpg)

## For SnapMobile

Using Ionic, this is a mobile app that uses Giphy's API to display three views in a grid: thumbnails of unicorn gifs, trending gifs and an option to search their database. Tapping on any of the thumbnails brings up a larger/zoomed in version of the selected. A tap on the larger image closes it. Infinite scrolling is available for the unicorns and trending views.

I've pretty much stayed with Ionic's tab view, modified accordingly, and initially set this up for iOS. Due to OS limitations, I could not test out the emulator.

Things to correct include:

~~1) Infinite scrolling and its image functionality for the search view.~~

~~2) Add search bar to the unicorns and trending views.~~

~~3) Correct glitch delay in image source popup.~~

4) Loading glitch with loading.gif
